got this error when i unpacked the extension to the chrome 

A "Service worker registration failed. Status code: 15" error generally indicates a 
script evaluation error in the service worker file itself, 
most commonly in the context of a Chrome extension. 
This means an error occurred while the browser was trying to run the script for the very first time.
